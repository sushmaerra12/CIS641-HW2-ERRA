<h3> Project description:</h3>
<p2>Many researchers are presently investigating how "smart" technology may be created, applied, and assessed in a wider health-care environment. These studies include a broad spectrum of human research, target audiences, objectives, and technological platforms. We are working on creating a smartphone app that can identify disorders, recommend simple treatments, and set up a consultation for additional testing with a physician as part of our development effort. In this proposal, we examine how intelligent technologies can help people accomplish tasks that they are unable to complete on their own while simultaneously motivating (or assisting) them to carry out as many tasks as they can independently.</p2>
